# STATE — where the project is right now

One screen. Consolidate reads this FIRST and writes it LAST; the memory file
points here instead of restating it. If this file and a conversation
disagree, this file is the claim to verify, not the conversation.

|---|---|
| **phase** | RESTRUCTURE PHASE CLOSED 2026-08-26 (docs/restructure-plan.md; P36 passed). Between phases — Sean's next three calls: (1) permanence tiers as the first `/add-rule` (P25), (2) batch 19's shape, (3) the UI chip pass |
| **track / piece** | none in flight. The restructure board is history (docs/restructure-plan.md); the rules ledger (267), the rulings maps, the rosters and the system census are the standing reference |
| **cycle step** | BATCH 18 CLOSED 2026-08-26 (changelog §12.59): 32 verdicts through research → verify → Sean → apply; afl_anime_canon_unruled 1 (assassination-classroom ep 0 → T4.4 format). Between batches |
| **last save point** | 2026-08-26: restructure phase CLOSED — P36 live (§12.63); T4-GLOSSARY §7 rewritten as closed / still-open |
| **next action** | Sean's call among: (1) `/add-rule` permanence tiers (P25 — LOCKED series skip routine deep; 15 candidates listed by T0); (2) batch 19 plan (P11: work-list from disk — the narrow-task queue in batch18/WAVE2/3-RECOVERY.md, the LN-side instrument T24 for the 33 pending LN series, `episode_without_component` 32 / `watch_order_kind_missing` 36 / `format_missing` 18, airdate queues 67 + 10, `mixed_fragment_only`); (3) the UI chip pass (format / adopted / sourceLabel / the `_` token grammar) |
| **awaiting Sean** | which of the three next; nothing else blocks |
| **open sidecars** | chain.ts#aggregate ↔ resolve.ts: source_type + manga_status unified in T4.1 (T25); the rest of aggregate's field-by-field duplication (status, dates, totals) still a T2 sidecar · A-6 healer over the 27 seeded starts (batch 18) · WIKI_NUMBERING_SHIFTS unification (§E.8) · kinnikuman/railgun dates (batch 18 narrow task) · kenshin-2023 rows 25-27 and beyblade-x 41-44 carry ANOTHER series' 1996/2001 titles+dates (wiki-backfill contamination, block-level — batch 18) · AFL trailing non-episode row (project-arms 53) as an add-rule sibling of G54 · 8 UNRECORDED override chains |
| **gates** | `npx tsc -b --noEmit` · `npm run lint` · `npm test` (now includes `scripts/ingest/lib/**/*.test.ts`) · `npm run build` · **`npm run system:census`** (ledger + citations, unpaged selects, one-hop, rosters, rulings index, generated docs, edge hash — red = blocking) |
